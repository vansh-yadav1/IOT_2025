# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on expanding the hospital management system with advanced doctor search capabilities. Core functionality for location-based search and Google Maps integration has been implemented successfully.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented role-based user registration
2. Added spatial indexing for location queries
3. Enhanced Google Maps integration with multiple features
4. Improved UI/UX with better information display
5. Optimized performance with caching and clustering

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
   - Provides efficient location-based queries
   - Supports complex spatial calculations
   - Enables future scalability

2. Implementing route caching
   - 5-minute cache duration
   - Balances freshness with API usage
   - Reduces response times

3. Using marker clustering
   - Improves map performance
   - Better visualization for dense areas
   - Enhanced user experience

### Current Considerations
1. Scaling strategy for larger datasets
2. Additional caching mechanisms
3. Real-time updates implementation
4. Error handling improvements
5. User feedback integration

## Next Steps
1. Doctor availability system implementation
2. Appointment scheduling feature
3. Enhanced filtering capabilities
4. User feedback system
5. Performance testing with larger datasets

## Current Challenges
1. Optimizing performance for larger datasets
2. Balancing real-time updates with system resources
3. Implementing comprehensive error handling
4. Scaling the spatial database efficiently
